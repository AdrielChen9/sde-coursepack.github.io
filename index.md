Welcome to "Software Development Essentials!"  This coursepack was created by Prof. Will McBurney to act as a form of online textbook, where all slides, coding examples, and other class items are stored.  

__THIS SITE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION.__

The material in this coursepack comes from [CS 3140: Advanced Software Development Techniques](http://cs3140.cs.virginia.edu) offered by the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu).

You are welcome to use the material on this website in your own class. Our only request is that you contact Prof. McBurney to let him know that you used some or all of the material. Feel free as well to send any feedback, let me know if you see me get anything wrong, or have any corrections!
