# Defensive Programming

I like to introduce the idea of defensive programming by talking about defensive driving.

When you were learning to drive, you were likely told that you should drive *defensively*. But what does that actually mean? Are we saying you should drive ready to protect yourself, with violence if needed, like some Mad Max action sequence? 

As fun as that sounds, no. **Defensive driving** is the idea that, when driving, you should be prepared for people around you to *do incorrect things*. For example, the car you are passing in the right lane may try to switch lanes for no clear reason while you are passing, so you should pay attention to that car as you pass. When the traffic light turns green, you should still look before you go to ensure the intersection is clear or no one is running the red light. As you go around a blind corner, you should be mentally prepared in case someone coming the other direction strays out of their lane and into yours.

Driving defensively is *driving so that if other drivers make a mistake, you won't get caught up in it.* You cannot control how other people drive. You can only drive in a way to maximize your own safety.
