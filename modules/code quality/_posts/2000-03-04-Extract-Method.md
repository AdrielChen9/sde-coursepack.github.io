Title: Refactoring - Extracting a Method

# Extracting Methods

In this module, we will look at the refactoring practice of extracting methods. We may extract methods for the following reasons:

* Address methods that are too large, breaking them into smaller methods
* Removing duplicate code and duplicate logic by extracting the repeated behavior into a single method
* Improve the readability of our code by encapsulating low-level logic into a method with an intent-communicating name.
