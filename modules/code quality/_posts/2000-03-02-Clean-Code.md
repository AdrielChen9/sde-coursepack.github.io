## Acknowledgement

Most of the material in this unit is derived from: 

* [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/B08X8ZXT15/) by Robert C. Martin, a book that I highly recommend and dramatically improved my own outlook on designing and writing software.
