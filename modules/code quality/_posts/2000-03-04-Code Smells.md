# Code Smells

A code smell, a term coined by [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck), refers to problems within the design and structure of the underlying code in software. However, code smells are explicitly not bugs or defects. Rather, they are problems with the **internal** quality of the software; that is, problems with maintainability, analyzability, complexity, testability, etc.
