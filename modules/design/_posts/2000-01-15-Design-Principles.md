# Design Principles

## KISS Principle

__Keep it simple, stupid!__

## DRY Principle

__Don't Repeat Yourself__

## YAGNI Principle

__You ain't gonna need it__

# SOLID

SOLID is an acronym for five Object-Oriented Design Principles.

* S - Single Responsibility Principle
* O - Open-Closed Principle
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
* I - Interface Segregation Principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

__Each software module should have one, and only one, reason to change__

## Open-Closed Principle

__A software artifact should be open for extension, but closed for modifications__

## Liscov Substitution Principle

__All subclasses should be substitutable for their base or parent class__

## Interface Segregation Principle

__A client should never be forced to depend on an interface they do not use__

## Dependency Inversion

__Entities should only depend on abstractions, not on concretions.__
