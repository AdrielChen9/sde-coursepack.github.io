# Course Materials

This page outlines our course materials. To contact the author, see the About page.

## Assignments

This course is intended to have 7 small-group (2-3 person teams) assignments. These assignments are each separate,
and students do not carry their own code over between assignments. This is because while this course is designed
to prepare students to work on projects, it is not itself a project course. The rationale for this decision is that
in project courses, if students get behind earlier, then it can often because an unsalvageable situation. We wanted to
avoid that, as this is typically a second-year (sophomore) course.

I will eventually post a set of 7 assignments that I have used. However, not all assignments are written yet. I can
share what assignments with instructors via email Please email from a verifiable institution or organization email address.

## Exams

The course has 3 exams. Each exam covers a certain subset of the course.

Generally, the tests break down as follows, as well as which modules are part of that exam:

* Exams 1 - Tools of the Trade
  * Intro
  * Java
  * Testing
  * Code Quality
* Exams 2 - Design
  * Design
  * Arch
  * Patterns
* Exams 3 - Front to Back
  * GUI
  * Data
  * Exam 3 is typically cumalative of all course content, but with an emphasis on GUI and Data

Exams are available upon request from instructors. Please email from a verifiable institution or organization email address.

## Slides

I will add my slide decks to this website in the near future, but I am prioritizing getting the course content up first.
