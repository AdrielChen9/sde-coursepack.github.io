# IntelliJ

IntelliJ is an IDE specifically designed for Java and Kotlin that we will be using in this class. You can
download the free [IntelliJ Community version here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows). However,
[students can get the full version here.](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) - Note that this 
requires a student email address with a University.

The license has some limits:
- May be used for educational purposes only
- The license must be renewed annually, and can only be renewed while you are an active student
- You cannot share this license with any third parties.

I strongly recommend getting the full version, as some features we will use are not available in the
Community version.
