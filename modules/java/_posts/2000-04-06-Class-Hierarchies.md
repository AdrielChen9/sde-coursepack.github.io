# Class Hierarchies

## Definitions
In Java, class hierarchy refers to the organization of classes. All classes in Java are organized into a hierarchy, with the root of the hierarchy being the `Object` class. This means that every class in Java ultimately inherits from the `Object` class, and can access its methods. Java's class hierarchy is based on the idea of inheritance, which allows classes to _inherit_ properties and behaviors from other classes. Specifically, a class that inherits from another class is called a `subclass` (or derived class), while the class it inherits from is called the `superclass` (or base class). 

The Java class hierarchy provides a way for developers to organize their code and create reusable, modular software components. It also allows for polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be used interchangeably, as long as they share a common superclass. This feature makes it possible to write __clean code__ which is more flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

### Superclass and Subclass

### extends

## Example: clocks

### Clock

### AlarmClock

## Code elements

### `public`, `protected`, `package-protected`, and `private`

### @Override

## `super` keyword

### `super()` in Constructors

### `super.` usage
