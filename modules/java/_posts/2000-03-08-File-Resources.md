Title: File Resources

# Resources in Java

Often, our programs will need to use external resources. These could include:

* Files on our computer
* The Internet
* A Database
* etc.

In this module, we will first look at some simple usage of resource files in Java.

Second, we will look at some basic File I/O in Java for reading and writing to
Plain Text files (like .txt or .csv).

## Resource Files/Assets

Often, when making a program or website, we will need assets. These assets could
include images, like this picture of my cat Chloe sitting on my shoulder despite
my wishes that she not:

<img alt="alt" src="{{site.baseurl}}/modules/java/images/8/chloe.jpg"/>

If I wanted to make this a company logo (and who wouldn't), then this image would
likely appear throughout any app I made. And so, I need to store that image with
the app's project code-base. And, in fact, the above picture *is* in this website's
code base.
