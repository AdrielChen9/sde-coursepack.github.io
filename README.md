#This is our implementation of the popular web game, Wordle by Adriel Chen and Edison Huang. This game allows you to 6 attempts to guess a 5 letter word. Letters that aren't in the word are greyed out, letters that are in the word but not in the right position are colored yellow, and letters that are in the word in the correct position are colored green.
